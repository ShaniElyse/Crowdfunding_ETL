# Crowdfunding_ETL
We created the Crowdfunding Database and then created category & subcategory, "campaign" and "contacts" dataframes. An example of a category is "music," the subcategory would be "indie rock."
Then once all data is collected, we created an ERD using QuickDBD, then saved the database schema and created a Postgres file.
